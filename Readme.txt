This is the hardware repository for the ODR-1 (Open Design Radio - 1) which is a stand-alone "Firmware" defined QRP transceiver.The design goal for the radio is to cover from 1.8MHz (160 meters) up to 50 MHz (6 meters) though it may be able to cover up to 70MHz (4 meters).

The ODR-1 radio consists of the following circuit boards:

1) Display Board
2) Processor Board
3) Oscillator & Mixer Board
4) Amp and tuner board (not released, under design)

Each board hardware revision will have its own directory. When the circuit board layout changes significantly, there is a letter revision. If a minor revision occurs, such as a component value change or a cut and add, then a numeric suffix will be added to the letter revision. this allows older boards to be modified while not impacting the release of new board designs.

All schematic capture and layout is done with stable releases of KiCAD. You are encouraged to support the KiCAD development team as it is an outstanding collection of software.
